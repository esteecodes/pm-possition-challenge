üéâ You are willing to join our lovely Positive Minds family.

We're happy to see creative and enthusiastic people, who can find their way along with **as-real-life-problems-as-possible** projects. We hope you have fun :tada: and teach us something new.

Here is the task to be implemented.

## Fake Product Search

A one single page or app should be implemented to render some fake product data in a list. The page renders an input field and a search button. In the input field, the number of products to render must be added by the user. Otherwise, an error message is displayed.

After entering the number of products which and be rendered, and clicking the search button, the result list is displayed (see design example). The products are requested from a REST web service - see below. The page is responsive and renders 2 tiles in a row for a mobile device, 3 tiles for the medium size screens (768-1024px) and 4 tiles in a row for large screens. The design just shows the mobile version.

For each tile, the main image, additional images, name, price, and tags for the product are rendered.

## Implementation Hints

- Use the following API to request fake products: https://fakerapi.it/en (scroll down to Products: https://fakerapi.it/api/v1/products?_quantity=1&_taxes=12&_categories_type=uuid)
- You can implement a single page React app or a static HTML page to fulfill the task
- You can use a CSS framework or standard library for styling as you like
- Don't use jQuery
- Use JavaScript with ES6 syntax for the implementation

üçÄ Good luck!
